Project Overview

This project analyzes crime statistics related to property stolen and recovered across Indian states and Union Territories over multiple years.
Using exploratory data analysis and interactive dashboards, it uncovers patterns in theft incidents, identifies recovery inefficiencies, 
and presents insights to aid law enforcement agencies and policymakers.

The key objectives are:

To understand state-wise trends in theft and recovery.
To calculate recovery effectiveness based on value and number of cases.
To provide interactive visual tools for decision-makers.
To recommend improvements in crime recovery strategies.

This project uses a combination of Python-based data science tools and interactive dashboards (Streamlit/Plotly/Power BI) to make the findings accessible and actionable.
